This is what I did:
- Cloned Code Challenge 
- Installed Python for VS
- Researched definition of a cluster -> using idea of hierarchical clustering (points are more related to closer points than farther ones)
- Researched algorithms for hierarchical clustering -> Determined that these algorithms will be too slow to work well
- Now using k-means clustering 
- Found Average Silhouette Method 
- Researched libraries/methods to implement K-Means Clustering/Silhouette Method -> Found sklearn
- Began preliminary coding
