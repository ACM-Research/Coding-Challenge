## Question One

![Image of Cluster Plot](ClusterPlot.png)
<br/>
Given the following dataset in `ClusterPlot.csv`, determine the number of clusters by using any clustering algorithm. **You're allowed to use any Python library you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file.


**My Explanation**

*To solve this problem, I first researched what a cluster is considered formally. After some searching, I decided to use a centroid-based definition so I could use k-means clustering 
in my solution (fairly fast when compared to other options). I then discovered the Average Silhouette method, which determines the most appropriate number of clusters for a data set.
I used sklearn for easy implementation of this method and pandas to transfer the spreadsheet's data to a more useful format. The solution found is the same as the intuitive solution 
(seems to be 2 clusters from the scatterplot).*
